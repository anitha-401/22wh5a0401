# Classic Retro Snake Game
Using MATLAB implemented the Classic Retro Snake Game. 
In which the input data and modules are as follows:
i. User input for snake movement.
ii.Random generation of food locations.
iii.Score tracking and display.
We implemented several algorithms to ensure smooth and efficient gameplay:
Snake Movement Algorithm: Handles directional changes and movement.
Collision Detection Algorithm: Ensures game ends on snake collisionwith walls or itself.
Food Consumption Algorithm: Detects when the snake eats food and grows.
This project allowed us to:Relive a classic game through modern technology.
i. Improve our programming skills in MATLAB.
ii. Learn about game development and user interface design.
